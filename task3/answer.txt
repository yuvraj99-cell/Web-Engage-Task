
1.  My approach of solving this issue would be... I will reach out to both customers to inform them of the delay caused by the family emergency and and request an extension of the deadline for their task.

For Task 1, as the low-priority customer has not provided a go-live date, the updated timeline can be discussed and agreed upon with them.

For 2nd Task, the priority customer's campaign needs to go live in the next 2 days. It is important to prioritize this task and take necessary steps to complete it as soon as possible, such as allocating additional resources or working extra hours, to ensure that the customer's deadline is met.

                      The form contains validation as mentioned in the task that the user can not type invalid email (having < minimum length).
                      The user can not submit the empty fields as it will show error message.
                      The mobile no. input box will take only digits and the length will be exact 10 else show error (Invalid contact number).
                      The pages are user friendly and attractive to engage the user's attention.
